All of these error codes require human intervention if they occur since a power cycle is the only effective method of dealing with them.
A watchdog timer will not work since it will kill the serial terminal on the PC side (Arduino devices have the reset pin of the USB CDC device connected to the reset pin of the ATMEGA328P).
